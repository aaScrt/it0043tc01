            <p class="desc">Professor Utonium is the creator and father of the Powerpuff Girls. He is known for his gentle ways and being much caring for his daughters. He is also an inventor and a scientist and has a huge merit of inventions in his backpack. His interactions with the girls often include what one would think of as common events in a household with three children, such as telling them to eat their broccoli.</p>

            <p class="desc">Blossom is the most outgoing and intelligent of her sisters, Blossom is the Powerpuff Girls' natural leader. She is quick-thinking, logical, analytical and has a strong sense of justice. She is the one who comes up with new team maneuvers and directs the Girls in battle. It's when she keeps everyone working as a team that her real abilities as a leader shine. Blossom enjoys her position and knows she's best suited for it; this can make her seem bossy and arrogant, but she is always willing to acknowledge a better idea and has the best interests of her sisters and Townsville at heart. She therefore has many arguments with Buttercup, as Buttercup thinks she should be the leader as she is the 'toughest fighter'.

            <p class="desc">Buttercup is the Toughest Fighter; she's the bravest, most headstrong of the superhero trio.  Buttercup is a fun-loving tomboy. With this trait, it could have represented her aggressive and violent nature. Buttercup is shown to be able to defeat villains alone in "Moral Decay." In "Makes Zen to Me," Buttercup sends Mojo flying out the window and down a cliff with one uppercut. In "The Boys are Back in Town," Buttercup always appears in a need to fight, while her sisters are in a need to run away. She is the fastest, as shown in "Speed Demon."</p>

She can scream loud enough to shatter glass or buildings and stun opponents. Bubbles can speak multiple languages (although throughout the series we don't hear her speak any language other than English, Japanese, Spanish, or Squirrel).</p>

Mayor, is the tritagonist of The Powerpuff Girls series, he is a primary character whose main role in the show is calling the Powerpuff Girls if trouble wreaks havoc over the town, but this is not always the case as he sometimes has a bad habit of asking them to help him with some trivial problem, such as opening a normal jar of pickles.
